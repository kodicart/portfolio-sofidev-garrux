				Iâ€™m a passionate web developer specializing in Angular, turning ideas into seamless digital experiences. I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about development trends, and contributing to open-source projects.

In my free time, I love park walks, experimenting with cooking, and diving into mystery novels. I chose this field to blend creativity with problem-solving and to keep learning and growing.
